# C Socket Programming Example

You will need to run each of these in a separate terminal

Make sure to run the receiver first, it should hang when it is running correctly and wait for you to run the sender.

To compile and run receiver.c:

```bash
gcc -o receiver receiver.c
./receiver
```

To compile and run sender.c:

```bash
gcc -o sender sender.c
./sender
```

To just run:

```bash
./receiver
./sender
```
